hebo
=====

A framework to develop Hadoop data processing task and manage their dependency in runtime.

* A dataflow scheduler based on cascalog for Hadoop tasks dependent each other.
* A DSL with an elegant way to write a single Hadoop data processing task.

## Core Concepts

Time series data can come in yearly, monthly or even daily and hourly depends on your requirements. Hebo system provides you a elegant way to deal with complex various transform of those different data granularities throughout workflows.

Suppose you have 3 tasks A,B,C, and they have following restrictions:

| taskname |   dependency | input-granu | output-granu | data-granu |      params     |
|:--------:|:------------:|:-----------:|:------------:|:----------:|:--------------:|
| A        |      null    | daily       | daily        | hourly     |[year month day]|
| B        |        A     | daily       | monthly      | daily      |[year month]    |
| C        |        B     | monthly     | daily        | daily      |[year month]    |

 
Now I will show you changes of a example data marked with 2014-02-20T23:55:05+0800 throughout this workflow.

1. A relies no tasks,so A can execute directly.the input-granu of A is daily,so its parameter may contains 2014 02 30,then data-granu of A is hourly,so 2014-02-20T23:55:05+0800 will be changed to 2014-02-20T23:00:00+0800,at last the output-granu is daily,so the output of A will gather all data of 2014-02-20 into a file.So final output file contains 2014-02-20T23:00:00+0800, 2014-02-20T22:00:00+0800, 2014-02-20T21:00:00+0800 and so on. 

2. B can't be executed until A is finished.the input-granu of B should be equal output-granu of A,because output-granu of B is monthly,it require the total days of the exact month,in another way,files such as 2014-02-20,2014-02-21,2014-02-22 will all feed B,therefore the param of B may contain 2014 02,and 2014-02-20T23:00:00+0800 changed to 2014-02-20T00:00:00+0800 according to data-granu.

3. C can't be executed until B is finished.the input-granu of C should be equal output-granu of B,becasue output-granu of C is daily,it will divide one monthly input file into multiple daily files,for example 2014-02.in will produce 2014-02-01.out,2014-02-02.out and so on. 2014-02-20T00:00:00+0800 remains the same according to its data-granu of daily.

## Getting started

### Requirements
  * add [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org/) to your path
  * add %HADOOP_HOME%/bin to your path
  * add %HEBO_HOME%/bin to your path

Here %HADOOP_HOME% %HEBO_HOME% refer the root folder of your hadoop and hebo   

### Demo code
```
(deftask A
    :desc    "desc of A"
    :cron    "0 12/45 * * * ?"
    :param   [:year :month :day]
    :data    {:granularity :hourly}
    :output  { :fs :hdfs :base "/path/to/output/of/A" :granularity :daily :delimiter "\t"}
    :query   (fn [fn-fgranu fn-dgranu timestamp source]
                (<- 
                   [?hourly ?result]
                   (source ?datetime ?line)
                     (fn-dgranu ?datetime :> ?hourly)
                     (process ?line :> ?result))))
```
```
(deftask B
    :desc    "desc of B"
    :cron    "0 12/45 * * * ?"
    :param   [:year :month]
    :data    {:granularity :daily}
    :output  { :fs :hdfs :base "/path/to/output/of/B" :granularity :daily :delimiter "\t"}
    :query   (fn [fn-fgranu fn-dgranu timestamp source]
                (<- 
                   [?hourly ?result]
                   (source ?hourly ?line)
                     (fn-dgranu ?hourly :> ?daily)
                     (process ?line :> ?result))))
                     
```
Codes above demonstrate the skeleton of a task. your business related code should be placed in :query entry.
